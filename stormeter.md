Storm Sentinel – Your Early Warning Storm Alarm System

Stay ahead of the storm with Storm Sentinel, the ultimate barometric pressure monitoring app designed to keep you informed and safe. Whether you're an outdoor enthusiast, weather watcher, or simply want peace of mind, Storm Sentinel gives you early alerts when sudden pressure drops indicate potential storms like hurricanes, tornadoes, or thunderstorms.

🌪 Why Choose Storm Sentinel?
Storms often arrive with little warning—but changes in atmospheric pressure can reveal them before they strike. Storm Sentinel continuously monitors barometric pressure trends, even while your phone is in your pocket or the app is in the background.

Using advanced local pressure tracking, real-time alerts, and visual alarms, Storm Sentinel keeps you informed about dangerous weather patterns before traditional forecasts do.

⚠️ Important Notes
Storm Sentinel requires a device with a barometric sensor (most newer smartphones support this).

Background monitoring may require enabling special permissions or using a development build of the app depending on your platform.

While Storm Sentinel offers early pressure-based warnings, it is not a substitute for official weather advisories.

Be ready before the storm hits.
